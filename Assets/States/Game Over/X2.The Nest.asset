    hear growling and get your rifle at the ready. Abel follows.\r\n\nOut of nowhere
    3 shadows appear. You and Abel turn around and start shooting. These are not
    any wild animals. You recognize these creatures, they are werewolves!\r\n\nBoth
    you and Abel start shooting but regular bullets won't do a thing. You get a few
    shots in but the werewolf surrounds the two of you.\r\n\nYou blackout, once you
    can open your eyes it's too late. You see Abel's dead body a few feet away and
    your vision starts to fade.\n\r\nGame Over!\r\n\n1.Play Again\r"
